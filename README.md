# Grade Calculator (Python Mini Project)

A simple Python script that calculates a student's grade based on their percentage score.

This is my first mini-project to practice core Python concepts such as user input, conditional logic, and basic output formatting. The goal was to build a clean, working script while improving coding structure and logical thinking.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This project was created as a beginner exercise to:

- Practice writing conditional (`if-elif-else`) logic
- Understand user interaction using `input()` and `print()`
- Build and test a simple CLI-based Python tool
- Start using VS Code for writing and testing scripts

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- The user enters their percentage score (e.g., 87.5)
- The program evaluates the grade based on the following scale:

| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|--------|
| 90+        | A      |
| 80+        | B      |
| 70+        | C      |
| 50+        | D      |
| Below 50   | F      |

- The result is printed to the screen in a user-friendly format
